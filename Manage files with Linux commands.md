# Scenario
In this scenario, you need to ensure that the /home/analyst directory is properly organized:

- You have to make a few changes to the /home/analyst directory and the files it contains.
- You also have to edit a file to record the changes or updates you make to the directory.

When you start, the /home/analyst directory contains the following subdirectories and files:

You need to modify the /home/analyst directory to the following directory and file structure:

![configured_tree](https://github.com/Cr1msonPho3nix/Linux_projects/blob/main/img/Manage%20files%20Linux/configured_tree_1.PNG)

## 1. Create a new directory
Creating new directory with the command "mkdir" and checking if it was created with "ls".<br>

## 2. Remove a directory

## 3. Move a file
Moving "Q3patches.txt" file to another directory and checking in both places if it was correctly moved with "ls".<br>
